Open questions for continuous simulation:
1. Does it make sense for this setting to overestimate SE when we saw an underestimation for binary?

2. Is there a way for us to mathematically determine the beta_0 intercept for this model similar to how we did in the binary model? Does this matter for our final performance measures?
- Similar results for very different coefficients, more in line with Hun's work on continuous in "Simple Bootstrap" folder.

3. Is there a coding mistake that might contribute to this result?
